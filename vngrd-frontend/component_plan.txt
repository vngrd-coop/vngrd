So the HomeFeed page could look like this from a Components perspective:

Page -> Feed -> PostMinimal -> GET /homefeed/

if this request returns empty, show button to BrowseCreators (they probably just signed up)

UserFeed: 
Page -> Feed -> PostMinimal -> GET /userfeed/<uid>

where GET /userfeed/<uid> returns JSON array of Post objects filtered by author
    field of who the user follows. parse request.get_full_path() to get uid & filter

HomePage:
Page -> WallOfText -> HomePage

CreatPostPage for creators:
Page -> CreatePost -> (text?podcast) -> (TextPost?PodcastPost) -> POST /createpost/

CreatePostPage for consumers:
Page -> CreatePost -> TextPost -> POST /createpost/


Authentication design:
- POST /signup/
  - email
  - username
  - password * 2
  - optional picture (random from pool of defaults will be assigned if none given)
  - Consumer or Creator?
    - if Creator: additional signup steps + vetting (pends account creation)
    - if Consumer: create account and redirects to HomeFeed 
- POST /login/
  - username
  - password
  - redirects to HomeFeed
- POST /resetpassword/
  - email
  - redirects to:
    - "No account with this email"
    - "Check your inbox and click the link"
      - Links to POST /setpassword
-POST /setpassword/
  - new password * 2 for confirmation
  - redirects to:
    - "Password Saved, go to HomeFeed?"
